This project allows the user to create map markers for the city of Boston by clicking on the button on the html file. These map markers are following a predetermined route that is defined by coordinates. These coordinates are plotted on the map using some built in functionality that is provided by mapbox.

To improve this project, I would create a button that brings up a text field that allows a user to input new coordinates into the geojson.features array. This would let them create a new circuit (that may not be for actual bus routes) so that they could track new points on the bus route. This would make the map more interactive for the user.
